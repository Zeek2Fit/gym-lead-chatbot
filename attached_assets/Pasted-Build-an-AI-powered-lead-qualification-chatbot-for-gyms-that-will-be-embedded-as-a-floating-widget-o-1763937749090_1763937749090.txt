Build an AI-powered lead qualification chatbot for gyms that will be embedded as a floating widget on WordPress websites.

PROJECT GOAL:
Create a conversational chatbot that captures and qualifies gym leads 24/7, then embeds seamlessly on WordPress sites as a bottom-right chat widget (like Intercom or Drift).

CONVERSATION FLOW:

1. GREETING (friendly, energetic tone):
   "Hey! 👋 Looking to get started with us? I can help you find the perfect fit. What brings you here today?"
   - Options: Weight loss, Build muscle, General fitness, Personal training, Just browsing

2. QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (conversational, one at a time):
   - "What's your current fitness level?" (Beginner / Some experience / Advanced)
   - "What's your main goal?" (Free text input - e.g., "lose 20lbs", "train for marathon")
   - "When are you looking to start?" (This week / Within a month / Just exploring)
   - "What's your budget range for membership?" ($50-100/month, $100-200/month, $200+/month, Not sure yet)

3. CONTACT CAPTURE:
   - "Perfect! Let me get your info so we can send you details and pricing."
   - Collect: Name, Email, Phone (with proper validation)

4. TRIAL BOOKING:
   - "Want to schedule a FREE 30-minute trial session?"
   - If YES: Show calendar picker with time slots (Mon-Sat, 6am-8pm in 30-min increments)
   - If NO: "No problem! We'll email you the info."

5. CONFIRMATION:
   - Show summary of their responses
   - Display next steps (e.g., "Check your email for confirmation" or "We'll text you within 24 hours")
   - Add celebratory confetti animation on booking confirmation

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

WIDGET EMBEDDING (CRITICAL):
- Create TWO files:
  1. Main chatbot app (the full interface)
  2. Embeddable widget loader (single <script> tag for WordPress)

- Widget should:
  - Float in bottom-right corner of page (60px circular button with chat icon)
  - Expand to 400px wide × 600px tall chat window on click
  - Overlay on top of existing page content (z-index: 9999)
  - Be mobile-responsive (full screen on mobile, widget on desktop)
  - Close button to minimize back to chat bubble
  - Show unread message indicator (optional but nice)

DESIGN:
- Modern gym aesthetic: bold, energetic colors (dark theme with teal/cyan accents)
- Clean, premium look (not generic chatbot vibes)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Progress indicator showing steps completed
- Professional font choices

DATA MANAGEMENT:
- Store all lead responses in localStorage (for demo purposes)
- Create simple admin panel (/admin route) showing:
  - All captured leads in a table
  - Export to CSV button
  - Basic filtering (by date, goal, budget)
  - Total lead count

WORDPRESS INTEGRATION:
- Provide clear instructions for embedding
- Generate embeddable code snippet (script tag)
- Ensure widget loads fast and doesn't conflict with WordPress themes
- Test that it works in an iframe if needed as backup

TECH STACK:
- Use React with Tailwind CSS OR vanilla JavaScript (your choice for speed)
- No external dependencies that require API keys
- Self-contained and works standalone
- Host-ready for Replit deployment

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
After building, please test:
1. Complete conversation flow from start to finish
2. Widget open/close functionality
3. Mobile responsiveness
4. Data saves correctly to localStorage
5. Admin panel displays leads
6. CSV export works
7. Embed code is ready to copy

DELIVERABLES:
1. Working chatbot with widget functionality
2. Admin panel to view leads
3. Embed code snippet (script tag) with instructions
4. README with WordPress installation steps

Build this step-by-step:
STEP 1: Create the conversational chatbot UI and logic
STEP 2: Add data capture and storage
STEP 3: Build the widget wrapper (floating button + overlay)
STEP 4: Create admin panel
STEP 5: Generate embeddable script tag
STEP 6: Test everything end-to-end

This needs to be WordPress-ready and demo
