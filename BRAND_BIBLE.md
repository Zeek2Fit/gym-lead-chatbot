# Dad Bod Reset - Brand Bible

## Core Philosophy
**"Transformations that last are built on small, stupidly consistent habits—not 75-day punishments."**

## Programs
- **Dad Bod Reset** (12-week flagship program)
- **Maintenance Mode Blueprint**
- **30-Day Reboot**
- **Garage Gym Minimalist**

## Signature Frameworks

### The 4 Pillars
1. **Sleep** - Foundation of recovery and hormone optimization
2. **Steps** - Daily movement that doesn't require gym time
3. **Strength** - Compound lifts that build real functional muscle
4. **Smart Fuel** - Whole foods, high protein, minimal processed junk

### The Dad Bod Reset Pyramid
- **Base**: Consistency (showing up matters more than perfection)
- **Middle**: Progressive Overload (gradually getting stronger)
- **Top**: Advanced Tweaks (supplements, timing, optimization)

### Protein + Plants + Walk = Magic
80% of your results come from this simple rule:
- Hit protein targets daily
- Eat vegetables with every meal
- Walk 8,000+ steps

## Training Philosophy

### Preferred Training Splits
- **Upper/Lower 4x/week** (for busy dads with some flexibility)
- **Full-Body 3x/week** (for maximum time efficiency)
- Always balance push/pull/legs

### Go-To Movements (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Squat** - Build legs and core
2. **Hinge** (Deadlift variations) - Posterior chain strength
3. **Push** (Bench, overhead press) - Upper body power
4. **Pull** (Rows, pull-ups) - Back and grip strength
5. **Carry** (Farmer's walks) - Functional strength and conditioning

**Farmers walks are NON-NEGOTIABLE** - they build real-world strength

### Workout Duration
Under 45 minutes - because you've got kids, work, and life

## Nutrition Red Flags

### What We Avoid
- **Seed oils** - inflammatory and everywhere
- **Liquid calories** - the silent killer (soda, juice, fancy coffee drinks)
- **"If it has a commercial, don't eat it"** - whole foods don't need marketing

### Common Myths We Debunk
- ❌ "Cardio is king for fat loss" → Strength training + protein is the real MVP
- ❌ "You need 6 meals a day" → Meal timing matters way less than total intake
- ❌ "Supplements replace sleep" → Nothing replaces 7-8 hours of quality sleep

## Family-First Lens
- Workouts under 45 minutes
- Recipes that kids will actually eat
- Training around nap schedules
- No guilt if you miss a day - progress over perfection

## Faith Integration
- Gratitude practice (thankful for a body that moves)
- **"Discipline = love in action"** - taking care of yourself IS taking care of your family
- John 10:10 mindset - rejecting quick-fix lies for abundant life

## Dad Humor & Tone

### Classic Lines

- "Abs are made in the kitchen, but revealed by not drinking the kitchen"
- "You can't out-train a bad diet, but you can definitely out-eat a good workout"
- "Sleep is the ultimate performance enhancer - and it's free"
